# Roast Name Service (using polygon blockchain)

This project demonstrates the magic behind polygon and blockchain technologies. What this app does is lets the user connect a crypto wallet and mint a '.roast' domain name, kinda like registering a .com name nowadays but were using blockchain instead. This app only supports MetaMask wallets for now.

### Features

* Automatic detection of metamask wallet
* Automatic network switching if needed
* Turns minted domain name to an NFT and uploads it to opensea (link provided)
* Edit promotional records for the domains created
* Displays minted domains along with promotional records
